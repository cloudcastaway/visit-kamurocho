# Visit Kamurocho

This repository contains a dark mode landing page inspired by **Kamurocho**, a fictional city from the _Like a Dragon_ video game series.  
The project was developed as part of my ongoing studies in web development, following a full stack learning path, using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

This is a solo project recommended within the Scrimba HTML and CSS course.  
The **idea and base layout were provided by the teacher**, but the implementation, styling, color palette, structure, and visual effects were developed independently.

The goal of the project is to practice semantic HTML, layout organization, and cohesive visual design without relying on JavaScript.
